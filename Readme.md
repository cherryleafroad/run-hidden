## About

run-hidden is a simple command line app that allows to run
console apps like powershell with hidden console window.

This one has been modified to run-as admin mode as well (with UAC prompt). In this way, it is in effect a UAC wrapper for any command.

## Example command line

`run-hidden powershell -command calc.exe`
